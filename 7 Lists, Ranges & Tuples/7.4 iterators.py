# iteratables are objects that represent a stream of data



# Create a list of items (you may use either strings or numbers in the list),
# then create an iterator using the iter() function.
#
# Use a for loop to loop "n" times, where n is the number of items in your list.
# Each time round the loop, use next() on your list to print the next item.
#
# hint: use the len() function rather than counting the number of items in the list.

string = "123456789"

#
# my_iterator = iter(string)
# print(my_iterator)
# print(next(my_iterator))
# print(next(my_iterator))
# print(next(my_iterator))
# print(next(my_iterator))
# print(next(my_iterator))

my_iterator = iter(string)

for i in range(len(string)):
    print(next(my_iterator))
