# Create a program that allows a user to choose one of 
# up to 9 time zones from a menu. You can choose any
# zones you want from all the all_timezones list.
#
# The program will then display the time in that timezone, as well
# as the local time and the utc time.
# 
# Entering 0 as a choice will quit the program.
# 
# Display the dates and time in a format suitable for the 
# user of your program to understand, and include the timezone 
# name when displaying the chosen time.
